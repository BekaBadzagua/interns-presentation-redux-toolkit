This is a single page web application Thats created for Redberry Internship Program using React. 
This is a PhoneBook application that allows user to make some crud operations on contacts and show or hide contact cards on dashboard.
The goal is to show interns what is Redux-Toolkit and how its used. Also since the presentation is specificly on Redux Toolkit there is the second part of the application in a different repository that we will use to compare redux vs redux-toolkit.
'interns-presentation-redux' that will be used to show difference between redux and redux-toolkit
